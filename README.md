My name is Abraham Getachew and I am a Full-Stack Developer with a passion for coding and building innovative projects.

I graduated from Heritage College in 2022, where I gained experience working in Agile methodologies and using technologies such as C# .NET, SQL Server, and Java. I've also been a part of a team that built a pet kennel reservation system, and a coding challenge system for my college.

I have experience in both front-end and back-end development, and have worked on projects in the government involving web pages that displayed reports of Medical Adjudication data, and the database that supported it.

I am a quick learner and am always looking to improve my skills. Currently, I am learning Angular.js and expanding my knowledge of AI and its potential impact on the financial and health industries.

Take a look at some of my projects and let me know if you have any questions or would like to collaborate. I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges!
